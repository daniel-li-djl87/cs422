Compile: make / make all
Run tests: make clean && make TEST=1
Run in qemu: make qemu / make qemu-nox
Debug with gdb: make qemu-gdb / make qemu-nox-gdb
                (in another terminal) gdb

Question A
1.) Occurs line 113 in boot1.S, after SMAP is loaded and ebx register is 0, change the lowest bit in the cr0 register to 1 to indicate the system is in protected mode
2.) The last instruction from bootstrap is: jmp *edx, the first instruction of the kernel is: cli
3.) The first instruction of kernel is at: 0x001023e0
4.) The bootloader decides how many sectors it must read by finding the first program
header from the elfheader and reading each section. The number of sections is stored by the
elfheader's e_phnum field. Then for each section, a for loop in readsection and keeps reading 
sectors from disk until at least "count" bytes have been read.
